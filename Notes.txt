TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript.
Means there is lot more in TypeScript including JavaScript. It just allow you to write JAVASCRIPT in much precise manner

All the things written in type is finally compiled into javascript

TypeScript is all about typesafety, which is not provided by JavaScript

What typeScript do ?
The key idea behind typescript is static checking

When the javascript run in the enviroment then only it throw the error while in TS there is a static checker which checks the
code as you try to write it.

In typescript you write lot more code compare to javascript

TS -> JS

TS is a developemnt tool, Your project still runs in javascript

Types of TypeScript?
Number String Boolean
null undefined void
Object Arrya Tuples ...
any never unknown


Here the typescript is smart enough the detect the data type of the variable.

Any is basically used to turn off the type checking of a varibale(this is usually we ignore)
noImplicitAny -> allow you to not fall in such things


To setp a project in TypeScript
tsc -> typescript compiler
tsc --init
it create a simple typescript config file, which gives you lots of options
package.json is for to install any node package or any lib


In the case of prodction you have two folders
dist(distribution) and src
src -> where you write your code
dist -> is something which get on to the production which is being served to the end user. (here all .js file automatically will get created)

tsc -w -> this tell to run it in the watch mode, which will look into tsconfig.json were the file is need to be created

by default everything in ts is public

null is treated as Object


TS is just to write the production level code
